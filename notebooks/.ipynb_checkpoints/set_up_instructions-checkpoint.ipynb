    "In the event that for some reason your Jupyter instance of Python isn't seeing your installed packages, this means that it's probably pointing to the wrong Python or the wrong path. First, diagnose the problem in Jupyter by running `!which python` (on Mac/Linux; `!where python` on Windows) and `import sys; sys.path`. The first command checks where it's looking for Python itself (using the terminal), while the second says where it's looking for packages. These answers should look the same from your own terminal as well -- if the answers differ between Jupyter and your terminal, then you've found your problem.  \n",
